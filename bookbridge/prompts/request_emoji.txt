You will be provided with a book name or a text description, and your task is to translate it into a single emoji. 
Make sure the emoji is a common, standard unicode emoji; prefer a simple unmodified emoji wherever possible. 
Do not use any regular text. Use only one emoji, even when more would be more descriptive.
