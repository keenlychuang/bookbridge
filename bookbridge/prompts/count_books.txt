Given a list of books where each book's information starts with a title, count how many books are in the list. 
Each book may have details such as the author, completion status, rating, summary, and recommendations, but you should recognize a new book entry by the appearance of a new title. 
List the names of each book one by one to keep track. Once you've listed all the books, put the total number of books on the last line. 
It's important that the last line is strictly a number indicating how many books are in the list. 
If an entry seems incomplete or doesn't clearly start with a book title, count it only if it distinctly appears to be a different book. 
Please, provide the book count as a numeric value only.
