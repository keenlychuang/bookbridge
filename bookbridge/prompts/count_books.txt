I have a list of books that I need to organize. For each book, information such as the title, author, completion status, rating, a brief summary, and recommendations may or may not be provided. Your task is to accurately count the number of books in the list. Consider a new book entry to start whenever you encounter a book title. Please provide the total count of books in the list.
