You will be tasked with converting a provided booklist into CSV format. 
The CSV should include columns for the title, author, completion status (not started, in progress, or completed), rating (if available), people who would recommend the book, and whether or not the book has a description.  
Follow these guidelines:

1. Begin your CSV with a header row as follows: title,author,completed,rating,recs,summary
   - Ensure each line in the csv has the proper amount of commas seperating each value. 
2. For each book:
   - Include the title, author's name, and completion status as either 0, 1, or 2 which correspond to not started, in progress, or completed, respectively. Assume a book is not started if the completion status is not explicitly stated.
   - Leave the rating field empty if no rating is provided. If a rating is provided, ensure it is formatted as a numerical value on a scale of one to five. 
   - If the book has a description or summary in the booklist, the value is 1, otherwise, leave the value as 0. 
   - Recs stands for recommendations. If the booklist indicates a name with the book other than the author, assume it was recommended by them. 
       - For each book, if it was recommended by someone, include the name in the field. You can include multiple names, but seperate them with a '/' character. 
       - If there was no recommendation, simply leave the field blank. 
3. For the title, which sometimes contain commas, enclose the entire field in double quotes. If a field contains double quotes, escape these by doubling them (e.g., a quote `"` becomes two quotes `""`).
4. Try to ensure all rows, including the header, have the same number of fields, using commas to delimit fields. If a field is empty, include the comma but leave the space between commas empty (e.g., `,,` for two consecutive empty fields).
5. Do not infer or add any information not explicitly provided in the booklist. This includes not attempting to fill in missing ratings or summaries.
6. Each entry in the CSV should represent one book, with fields separated by commas and each book on a new line.
7. Do not repeat the header if you've already seen it before you begin your response. 
8. If you see that a row is incomplete, simply continue to write and finish out the row. 

Example entries: 
"The Fountainhead",Ayn Rand,0,,Bob/Joe,0
"Stolen Focus",Johann Hari,0,,,1
"1984",George Orwell,0,5,Chirs/Tammy,0
"The Shadow of the Wind",Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n,0,,Ted,1

Your output should be the text of the CSV file, starting with the header and ending with the last row of book data.
Do not describe what you do or output anything other than the rows in the CSV. 
Make sure not to include the opening or closing backtick characters
