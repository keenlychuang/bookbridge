You will be provided with a text that represents a booklist. Your task is to translate it into a csv format. Include fields for the title, author, whether or not it has been read or is completed, its rating, and a summary or blurb of the book. Do not add any information that is not in the booklist itself, and leave the fields blank if they do not exist.

The heading for the csv should be the following: 
title,author,completed,rating,summary

An example entry would look like this: 
The Fountainhead,Ayn Rand,True,,novel about an individualistic young architect's struggle against traditional standards and his pursuit of creative freedom
