# Booklist Import Tool

Welcome to the Booklist Import Tool repository, where the joy of reading meets the efficiency of technology. This project is born out of a personal need to organize an old booklist into a more dynamic, shareable, and insightful format. Leveraging the power of Notion and cutting-edge LLM APIs, this tool aims to transform traditional booklists into an interactive database that not only showcases what I've read and what's on my wishlist but also categorizes books by various attributes for better organization and sharing capabilities.

## Background and Overview

As an avid reader, I've accumulated a substantial list of books over the years, categorizing them by what I wanted to read, what I had completed, and the type of books they are. With an intention to share my reading journey more publicly and to organize my collection with greater sophistication, I've chosen Notion as the platform for its unparalleled ability to present, store, and share information.

This project serves multiple purposes:
- **Organization:** To transition from old lists to a more flexible and informative medium.
- **Learning:** To gain hands-on experience with LLM APIs and software engineering practices.
- **Sharing:** To create a space that not only allows me to share my reading list with friends but also provides a template for others to create their own.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Transfer:** Successfully import the old booklist into Notion, enabling the deletion of old pages and categorization of books by attributes such as author, fiction/non-fiction status, genre, completion status, recommendations, ratings, blurbs, and personal notes.

2. **Engineering Learning:** Dive deep into the workings of APIs, specifications, testing, and implementation phases of software development.

3. **Sharability:** Create a subspace within my workspace to share with friends and develop shareable code/scripts for broader use.
